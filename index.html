                I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
                knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks,
                I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also
                master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
                push in my career as a software developer.

                Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was
                really different from the self learning I started with. The
                learning was fun and there were some internship job
                opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig
                immediately after the program. Thank you Tech Studio for that
                push I needed.

                <p>
                  There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
                  developer because there is a consistent demand for developers
                  who both write high-quality code and experienced problem
                  solvers who can design creative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The web and the applications built for it have transformed the
                  way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from
                  education to manufacturing.

                  development environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an
                  ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in
                  many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex
                  data sets, securing your applications with encrypted
